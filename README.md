# ywycms

### ¿¿¿???
This will be the cms i use for my personal website, nothing pretencious but qt and functional.

### Functions

#### Easy multilang
Simply manage various versions of the files, each one in the langs you want. If you enable two or more languages, te script automaticly create a copy of each html file to be the other-lang version.
The template site suggests to have a file with common phrases, to fast edit menus, footer, and other static things.

#### File Manager
Manage all your site html, php, css pages easily. Click and edit (simple input, not hints, shortcuts or anything). Duplicate, edit, delete, not more. The only extra function provided is a list of other files to easy link. 

#### Files
Upload any kind of file to be availibe for the world and your site. Most minded to use for upload photos or docs for the site.

#### Login
Enter to your control panel and do your things, login data is in a file.

### Programming philosophy of this project:
The goal of this script is to be very simple and fast programmed (not much code). Less is more, hard code is ok, only do the things work NAO.
